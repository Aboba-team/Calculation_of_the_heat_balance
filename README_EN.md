The final heat balance in a mold plays a critical role in the process of casting metal parts. This important technological property allows determining how much heat is absorbed by the casting and how much heat needs to be dissipated from the mold to ensure a stable casting process. To effectively manage this process, an application has been developed for calculating the heat balance in the mold.

**General Description:**

This Python-based application is designed for calculating the heat balance in molds during the casting of metal parts. It allows you to determine how much heat is delivered from the molten metal and how much heat must be dissipated from the mold to ensure optimal casting conditions.

**Key Features:**

1. **Calculation of the Total Heat Supplied to the Mold (Q_INPUT):** The application enables you to calculate the total amount of heat received from the casting during the casting process. This includes the heat of metal superheating, crystallization heat, and cooling heat of the casting.

2. **Calculation of the Total Heat Dissipated from the Mold (Q_OUTPUT):** Users can determine the total amount of heat that needs to be dissipated from the mold to the surrounding environment during the casting process.

3. **Assessment of the Need for Heating or Cooling Systems:** The application allows you to analyze the heat balance and determine whether the introduction of a heating or cooling system for the mold is required.

4. **Calculation of Heating and Cooling System Parameters:** If a heating or cooling system is necessary, the application helps calculate parameters such as heater power, heater wire diameter, heater coil length (for heating systems), as well as water flow rate and hole diameter (for cooling systems).

5. **Support for Various Materials and Conditions:** The application considers different materials, temperatures, and mold design parameters, making it a flexible tool for various technological tasks.

6. **User-Friendly Interface and Results Visualization:** The application's user interface provides a simple and intuitive way to input data and view calculation results.

**Downloading the Compiled Version:**

In addition to using the application's source code for heat balance calculations directly from the repository, we also provide the option to download a ready, compiled version of the application. This allows users unfamiliar with the process of compiling Python applications to quickly obtain and use the application on their devices.

To download the compiled version of the application, follow these steps:

1. Go to the "Releases" page in the GitHub repository or use this link: https://github.com/teslaproduuction/Calculation_of_the_heat_balance/releases.

2. Find the latest release where the compiled version of the application is available.

3. In the "Assets" section, locate and download the file with an extension that matches your operating system (e.g., .exe for Windows, .app for macOS, or .tar.gz for Linux).

4. After the download is complete, install or run the application according to the instructions for your operating system.

This application is a valuable tool for engineers and technologists working in the field of casting metal parts. It helps optimize the casting process, improve product quality, and conserve resources.
